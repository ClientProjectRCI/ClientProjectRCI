Client Group Project: RCI - Rochester Community Initiative
Currently working with a team of developers and RCI to create a scope document. Once approved by client, our team will begin development of the app. 
Mental health care providers will be able to create a profile to be viewed by patients looking for care. Those looking for specific mental healthcare will be able to search the RCI database and locate providers that match.
